There is a lot of potential in these brushes, as they eliminate the tools normally needed for watercolor paintings. They are also extremely portable, allowing one to paint on the go. \n\n  Water brushes are so simple to use, anyone can enjoy it. Just fill the water brush with water and you have a brush that is moist and ready to paint. One full water brush can paint an entire canvas without the need to refill! They're great for blending watercolor paints to create a natural, smooth gradient of colors.\n\n❖ Jay Lee is a specialized watercolor artist.
